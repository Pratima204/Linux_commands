##Using nmcli to configure static IP

- nmcli device (Get the listing of network interface)
- nmcli connection modify enp0s3 ipv4.addresses 10.253.1.211/24 (subnet that I want to use is /24 and ping ip before and make sure its not used)
- nmcli connection modify en0s3 ipv4.gateway 10.253.1.1
- nmcli connection modify en0s3 ipv4.method manual
- nmcli connection modify en0s3 ipv4.dns 8.8.8.8
- nmcli connection down en0s3
- nmcli connection up en0s3
- ip address show en0s3

## Adding secondary static IP using nmcli

- nmclu device status
- nmcli connection show -active
- ifconfig
- nmcli connection modify enp0s3 +ipv4.addresses 10.0.0.211/24
- nmcli connection reload
